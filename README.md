# Sklearn with Docker

In the notebook, you will see an example of a sklearn model exposed as an API with Flask and then built into a Docker Image/Container.
Instead of dealing with one prediction at a time, this API can take a JSONised Pandas Dataframe as an input and returns a JSONised Pandas Dataframe as an output.

Enjoy
